# Greedy Method
* A greedy algorithm is an approach/design for solving a problem 
  by selecting the best option available at the moment.

* Used to solve optimization problem. [ what is min or max ]

## Eg. Find the **minimun** time require to travel from place A to B:
* There can be many possible ways to travel from A to B
  but we need the shortest path possible. [define by constrain **minimun**]

### Here we have two kinds of solution:

1. **Feasible** which satisfy the problem. 
  * [eg. one of way A -> B. but might not be in min time.]

2. **Optimal** which satisfy the problem and constrain [here **min time**].
  * [eg. the only way A -> B which takes min time.]
